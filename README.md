# PROJECT NAME

Employee Reimbursement System

## Project Description

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

## Technologies Used

* Spring Tools Suite 4 - version 4.8.1
* Visual Studio Code - version 1.63.2
* DBeaver - version 21.3.1

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Registration page adds users to databse
* Logging in looks for a username and password match in the database and logs in only if a match is found
* Managers can pull up a table of all submitted reimbursements and change the status of them

To-do list:
* A more elegantly designed webpage
* When logging in, managers and employees get taken to the page specified for their role without having to check the 'Finance Manager' box.

## Getting Started

- git clone https://github.com/JavaNextGen/project-1-StevenWright99.git

- Import the Java files into Spring Tools and run the Launcher
- Open the Visual Studio Code HTML and JavaScript files in Visual Studio Code and run the login.html file
